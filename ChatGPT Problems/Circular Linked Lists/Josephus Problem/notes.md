# Josephus Problem Visualization

This document visualizes the `josephus` function in a C++ program, which solves the Josephus Problem using a circular linked list.

## Problem Setup

- **Number of People (`numberOfPeople`):** 10
- **Step Count (`stepCount`):** 3
- The circular linked list initially looks like: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 1`.
- The `tail` pointer initially points to node `10`.
- The goal is to eliminate every 3rd node until only one node is left.

## Iteration Process

### Iteration 1

1. **Start:** At node `10` (tail).
2. **Move:** `2` steps (since `[ stepCount - 1 ] = [ 3 - 1 ] = 2`).
   - From `10` to `1`, then `1` to `2`.
3. **Position:** `tail` is now at node `2`.
4. **Delete:** `tail->next` (node `3`) is to be deleted.

    ```plaintext
       tail
        ↓
    1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10
        ↑
    toDelete
    ```

5. **Result:** After deletion, the list is `1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 1`.

### Iteration 2

1. **Start:** At node `2`.
2. **Move:** `2` steps.
   - From `2` to `4`, then `4` to `5`.
3. **Position:** `tail` is now at node `5`.
4. **Delete:** `tail->next` (node `6`) is to be deleted.

    ```plaintext
           tail
            ↓
    1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 6 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 1
            ↑
        toDelete
    ```

5. **Result:** After deletion, the list is `1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 9 -> 10 -> 1`.

### Iteration 3

1. **Start:** At node `5`.
2. **Move:** `2` steps.
   - From `5` to `7`, then `7` to `8`.
3. **Position:** `tail` is now at node `8`.
4. **Delete:** `tail->next` (node `9`) is to be deleted.

    ```plaintext
               tail
                ↓
    1 → 2 → 4 → 5 → 7 → 8 → 9 → 10 → 1
                ↑
            toDelete
    ```

5. **Result:** After deletion, the list is `1 -> 2 -> 4 -> 5 -> 7 -> 8 -> 10 -> 1`.

This process continues until only one node remains. Each iteration removes one node and adjusts the pointers to maintain the circular structure of the list. The `tail` pointer aids in traversing and modifying the list, ensuring the correct node is deleted in each step.

## Conclusion

The last remaining node in the circular linked list represents the safe position in the Josephus Problem.


# Another explanation 

### Josephus Problem Visualization

Consider a small circular linked list for the demonstration, with `tail` initially pointing to Node E:
```
A → B → C → D → E
↑               │
└───────────────┘
```
Assume `stepCount` is 3. We'll walk through a couple of iterations to see what happens, especially at the line `tail->next = toDelete->next`.

#### Initial State

- `tail` is at Node E.
- Our list is: A → B → C → D → E → A...

```
               tail
A → B → C → D → E
↑               │
└───────────────┘
```

#### First Iteration

1. **Move `tail` `stepCount - 1` times**:
   - Step count = 3
   - Move from E to A, then to B. (`tail` is now at B)

2. **Identify `toDelete` node**:
   - `toDelete` is `tail->next`, which is C.

3. **Delete `toDelete` and update pointers**:
   - Before deletion:
     ```
        tail
         ↓
     A → B → C → D → E
             ↑
          toDelete
     ```
   - Perform `tail->next = toDelete->next`:
     - B's(or tail's pointer) next pointer points to  D, effectively removing C from the list.
     - Remember, toDelete was just pointing at C the step prior
     - So tail is pretty much 'skipping' where C used to be to keep the circular links
   - After deletion:
     ```
        tail
         ↓
     A → B  ------->  D → E
     ↑                   │
     └───────────────────┘
     ```

#### Second Iteration

1. **Move `tail` `stepCount - 1` times**:
   - Move from B to D, then to E. (`tail` is now at E)

2. **Identify `toDelete` node**:
   - `toDelete` is `tail->next`, which is A.

3. **Delete `toDelete` and update pointers**:
   - Before deletion:
     ```
           tail
            ↓
     ... → E → A → B → D → ...
               ↑
          toDelete
     ```
   - Perform `tail->next = toDelete->next`:
     - E's next is now B, effectively removing A from the list.
   - After deletion:
     ```
           tail
            ↓
     ... → E -----> B → D → ...
     ↑                       │
     └───────────────────────┘
     ```

#### Continuing...

The process repeats until only one node is left. The function then returns the data of this surviving node and deletes it, completing the Josephus operation.

This Markdown visualization should help clarify how the line `tail->next = toDelete->next` functions in the Josephus problem on a circular linked list.
